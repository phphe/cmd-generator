For example, you can send packets to Google to test whether Internet connections are normal:<pre><code>ping www.google.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Checking network latency: The <code>ping</code> command can also be used to test network latency. For example, you can send multiple packets to a host and calculate the average response time:<pre><code>ping -c 10 www.baidu.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Tracing network routes: The <code>ping</code> command can be used to trace the route of packets from the source host to the destination host. For example, you can use the <code>t</code> parameter to continuously ping the destination host and view the routers passed in the middle:<pre><code>ping -t www.qq.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Checking network stability: The <code>ping</code> command can also be used to check the stability of network connections. For example, you can send a large number of packets to the target host to test whether network connections will be lost:<pre><code>ping -c 1000 www.taobao.com\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Checking network bandwidth: The <code>ping</code> command can also be used to test network bandwidth. For example, you can send a large number of packets to the target host and calculate the amount of data sent per second:<pre><code>ping -s 1472 -M do -c 100 www.163.com | awk &#39;/packets/{print $8 $9}&#39;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}
